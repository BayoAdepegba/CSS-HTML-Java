How to setup an HTML File

Hyper Text Markup Language files require certain elements to set up the document properly
You can let web broswers know you are using HTML by starting your document
with a document type declaration

Declaration looks like this
	<!DOCTYPE html>

This declartion is an instruction AND IT MUST be the first line of code in your HTML Document
It tells the broswer what type of document to expect along with the version if HTML is being used
HTML5 is the current standard

HTML code is always saved in a file with an .html extension

DOCTYPE declarations are only required for html based documents. Other JavaScript or CSS files are actually loaded into the page with <link> or tags. 
These tags signify the file type to the browser thereby allowing the browser to properly parse the file.

Even though the HTML5 doctype declaration is dramatically simplified, it is still required so that the browser knows which version of HTML is being used. 
Once it knows , then it is able to render the document in “strict mode.” If no doctype is declared, then it can still tell that the document 
is HTML based on the file extension and <html></html> tag pair, but since it does not know which version of HTML is being used, it renders the document in “quirks mode.”

The <!Doctype html> Provides the broswer with the type of document and html version to expect
but it doesnt actually add any code to the structure or content.

To create html Strcture and content we must add opening and closing <html></html> tags after delcaring
<!DOCTYPE html>

anything between the opening and closing <html></html> tags will be interepreted as HTML Code

Including optional tags enhances readability, improves cross-browser support, and takes some burden off of the browser

the <head> element goes above our <body> element
the <head> element contains the metadata for the webpage.
Metadata is information about the page that isnt displayed directly on the webpage.
The metadeata in the <head> is information about the page itself.
<head></head>

Metadata not displayed on a page but behind the scenes it can be used by other software 
(web crawlers, search engines, browsers, etc.) to process, encode, extract or index all sorts of interesting information 
(geographic coordinates, calendar events, contact info, etc.). What’s more, businesses are often interested in using metadata to improve SEO or Search Engine Optimization.

HTML is read by the browser from the top of the document to bottom of the document. Important data (language, characters, frameworks, etc.) 
is stored in the section and should be as close to the top of the document as possible so the browser knows how the page should be displayed.

A browser's tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. 
The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>

<!DOCTYPE html>, the declaration specifying the version of HTML for the browser
The <html> tags that enclose all of your HTML code
The <head> tag that contains the metadata of a webpage, such as its <title>

You can add links to a web page by adding an Anchor element <a></a> and including the text of the link between the tags
The anchor element is incomplete with out the href attribute.
Href stands for hyperlink reference and is used to link to a path or address to where a file is located
<a href= link to webpage> with explantion here</a>

The target attribute specifices how a link should open

For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. 
The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

Setting the target attribute to "_blank" instructs the browser to open the page in a new window.

there are 4 different values the target attribute can have: _self, _blank, _parent, or _top. 
These values specify a browsing context or the environment in which the browser will display a document. 
To learn about each of these values, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a

1._self - Loads the url into the same browsing context as the current one
2._Blank - Loads the URL into a new browsing context. Either a tab or a new window
3._parent - Loads the URL into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent behaves the same way as _Self
4._top - Load the URL into the top-level browsing context (that is, the "highest" browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). 
If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.

When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, 
or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored

project-folder/
|—— about.html
|—— contact.html
|—— index.html

The example above shows three different files — about.html, contact.html, and index.html in one folder.

HTML files are often stored in the same folder as shown above.
If a browser is displaying one file it knows that other files are within the same folder and can link web pages toger using relative path

<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>

In this example, the <a> tag is used with a relative path to link from the current HTML file to the contact.html file in the same folder

A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website such as ,/index.html)
the ./ tells the browser the look for the file in the current folder.

Html allows you to turn any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. 
You can turn images into links by simply wraping the <img> element with an <a> element.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"><img src="#" alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/></a>
In the example above, an image of a prickly pear has been turned into a link by wrapping the outside of the <img> element with an <a> element

In order to link a target on the same page we must give the target an id.

<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1

in this example, the <p> element is assigned an id of "top" and the <h1> element is assigned "bottom." 
An id can be added to most elements on a webpage

An id should be descriptive to make it easier to remember the purpose of a link. 
The target link is a string containing the # character and the target element's id.

Programmers use two tools to help visualize the relationship between elements
Whitespace and Indentation
The position of elements in a browser is independent of the amount of whitespace or the indentation in the index.html file.
The browser ignores white space in html files when it renders(loads) a web page.

Whitespace is any character or series of characters which creates space on a page but does not display a visible mark. Common whitespace characters include tabs and spaces.

Indentation is a type of horizontal whitespace strategically used to enhance the readability of our code. 
For example, in HTML it is best practice to consistently indent our code to clearly illustrate nestings.

HTML Allows you to add comments to your code

Comments begin with <!-- and end with -->. Any characters in between will be ignored by your browser

Including comments in your code is helpful for many reasons:

They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
A webpage's title appears in a browser's tab.
Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.
