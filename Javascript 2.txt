In Programming a Variable Is a Container for a Value live in a computers memory.
A variable holds whatever information you want to apply to a specific value such as 
a username, account number, or personalized greeting.

Variables allow you t label data with descriptive name to help programs be understood clearer
Things you can do with variables:
1. Create a varibale with a descriptive name.
2. Store or Update information stored in a variable.
3. Reference to "get" information store in a variable.
Variables are not Values; They contain values and represent them with a name.
Var., Let., and Const., are keywords to create/Declare Variabeles.

Var - Short for variable. keyword to create or declare a new variable
myName- is the variables Name.
CamelCasing is groupig words into one. The firstword lower case and every word after
will have its first letter uppercased (camelCaseEverything)
= is the assignment operator, it assigns the value to the variable
Variable is initlizaed with a value

Once value is assigned to variable it can be delcared by referencing the variable name
console.log(myName)

1.Variable Names cannot start with numbers
2.Variable Names are case sensitive so "myName" and "myname" would be different
3.Variable Names cannot be the same as keywords

Var myName = "Bayo"

Let = variable can be assigned a different value
Let Meal = Tacos
Console.log(Meal);

Can declare a variable without assigning the variable in the value.
Variable will be initlizaed with a value of Undefined.
Can change a variable value after it has already been assigned
Ex. 
let changeMe = true;
changeMe = false;
console.log(changeMe)
changeMe has been reassigned a value to false.

Const variable is similar to Var and Let but cannot be reassigned because it is constant
if you try to reassing you'll get a TypeError
Const Variables MUSTbe assigned a value when delcared.
If you need to reassign a variable use let or var, otherwise const is fine.

Mathematical Assignment Operators
Assigning variables with numbers in math problems to perform math operations.
+= Assignment operator to reassign and add current value. w +=1 or w = w + 1
-+ assignment operator to subtract and reassign current value. x-=5 or X = X - 5
*= assignment operator to multiply and ressaign current value. Y *=2 Or y = y * 2
/= assignment operator to divide and reassign current value. z/= 2 or z = z /2

Other Mathematical assignment operatoers include
Increment Operator (++) will crease the value of the variable by 1.
Example.
let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11

Decrement Operator (--) will decrease the value of the variable by 1.
Example.
let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19

String Concatenation with variables
+ Operator can be used to combine two string values even if value are being store in variables

Sting Interpolation - Can insert variables insto strings using template literals
A template literal is wrapped by backticks ` ${}
example
let myName = 'Bayo';
let myCity = 'Glenarden';

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My favorite city is ${myCity}.` );


typeof Operator - Check the data type of a variables value. Will show you the fundamental
data type
example
let newVariable = 'Playing around with typeof.';
console.log(typeof newVariable)
// Output: String
