HTML Provides strcuture to the content on a website such as images, texts or videos.
HTML = HyperText Markup Language
A markup language is a computer lanaguage that defines the strcture and presentation
of raw text.
in HTML the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML Elements.
Hypertext/Hyperlinks is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to
other text through links.

HTML is a way to write content while CSS is a way to format that content.
Css allows you to design the content written in HTML

HTML is composed of Elements. Elements structure the webpage and define its content.

A tag and the content between it is called and HTML element
<p> Hello World </p>

Html tag is the element name, surrounded by an opening(<) and closing (>) angle bracket

Opening tag is the first HTML Tag used to start an HTML element. surrounded by
opening and closing angle brackets.

Content is the information contained between the tags
Closing tag- is the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. 
Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket

In coding p stands for paragraph
<img> is a self-closing tag

<p>, <div>, and <span> elements can contain text whereas elements like <ul> or <ol> should only contain <li> elements as direct children.
Block level tags like the <div> can contain all tags that can exist within the <body> 
(in other words, we can nest other elements within a <div>) 
whereas self-closing tags like <img> can not contain any content at all

HTML is a parent, and all elements that follow are children. BODY is a direct child of HTML, 
and only one of a handful that are allowed. Everything the user sees will be contained in the body of the document. 

html
* head
* body
    + div
        + p
            + text node
        + text node
    + text node
    
The root of the tree is html, the trunk, body. DIV is a branch node, and P a leaf node off that, 
with the text being the surface of the leaf. Note that the user sees the leaves of the tree. 

Body Element is one of the Key HTML Elements used to build a webpage.
<body> </body>
Once the file has a body many different types of content can be added 
Such as: text, images and buttons.

You would add code between opening and closing body tags
   
   
Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior 
and styling from their parent element. You'll learn more about webpage hierarchy 
in when you start digging into CSS   

that <div> elements are often used to group related content. 

The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a documenT

Headings are used to describe content.

In HTML there are six different headings or heading elements. Headings can be used for a varitey of purposes.
like titling sections, articles or other forms of content.

They are ordered from largest to smallest in size.

<h1> â€” used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for subheadings.
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>


the <title> tag can only be used within the <head> element and (unlike the h1-h6 elements) is never used to create a heading hierarchy within the <body> of an HTML document. 
The content of the <title> tag will display within a window tab but not within the page itself.


<div> Is short for "division" or a containter that divides the page into sections. Sections are useful for grouping elements in HTML
<div> can contain any text or HTML elements such as links, images, or videos.

Always add two spaces of identation when you nest elements inside of <div> for better readability

When using <div> tags as containers, it is true that our nesting might become more complex. However, 
the benefit is that if we create a thoughtful HTML structure we can more readily parse and target related content. 
In other words, there is often a trade-off between complexity and either readability or targetability. 
As developers, we want to find the right balance between creating enough coherent structure 
to enhance readability and targetability without venturing into

If we want to expand and Elements tag we can do so using Attribute.
Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways
from providing information to changing styling.
Two parts of Attributes
The Name of the Attribute
The Value of the Attribute

Commonly used attribute is id, Id attribute is used to specify diffrent content like <div>
it is help ful when you use an element more than once.
Ids have different purposes in HTML. Identify Content on our page

When adding an id to a <div> we place it in the opening tag

the id attribute uniquely identifies an element whereas the class attribute identifies a whole group of elements. 
This labeling information can then be used to target content for styling, scripting, or (for the id attribute) linking. 
For more information about these attributes, check out classes vs ids https://www.codecademy.com/articles/classes-vs-ids

If you want to display text in HTML, you can use Paragraph <p></p> or <span></span>

Paragraph <p> contain a block of plain text while
<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. Used to seperate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.

It's best to use a <span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline, or on the same line as other text. 
If you want to divide your content into blocks, it's better to use a <div>

<div>
  <h1>Technology</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <p><span>Self-driving cars</span> are anticipated to replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.</p>
</div>

In the example above, there are two different <div>. The second <div> contains a <p> with <span>Self-driving cars</span>. 
This <span> element separates "Self-driving cars" from the rest of the text in the paragraph

As the exercise alludes to, there exists block-level elements (<div>, <p>, etc.) and inline-level elements (<span>, etc). One of the big differences between these two types of elements is that a block element will take up the entire width of its containing element. This means that by default <div> and <p> elements will push sibling elements to a new line or section of the page.

On the other hand, inline elements make more conservative use of space. 
They take up only as much space as they need and will not force surrounding content to a new line

You can style text using HTML tags. 
<em></em> tag emphasizes text
<strong></strong> tag highlights important text

The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis

<p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long 
(approximately 4,260 miles).</p>


In this example, the <strong> and <em> tags are used to emphasize the text to produce the following:

The Nile River is the longest river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).

A key component of a web browser is its rendering engine.

A style sheet is a CSS document which specififies the presentation of the content described by associated HTML
Style Sheets style our web pages.

Spacing between code in an HTML file doesnt affect the positioning of elements in the browser.

To modify spacing in the browser yu can use HTML's Line Break element <br>
Line break element is only composed of a starting tag. can be used anywhere in html and a line break will be shown in the browser.

You can also display content in an easy-to-read list.
You can use an Unordered list tag <ul> to create a list of items in no particular order
an Unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point

<ul> element should not hold raw text and wont automatically format raw text into unordered list of items
individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag.
The <li> or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.

<ul>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Tortillas</li>
  <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>

In the example above, the list was created using the <ul> tag and all individual list items were added using <li> tags.

The output will look like this:

Limes
Tortillas
Chicken

The <li> element can be a direct child of either the <ul> or the <ol> elements but it should never exist outside of either of these parent elements.

<ol> is Ordered lists and each list item is Numbered.
Look for <ul> <li> <menu>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
  <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
  <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li>
</ol>

The output will look like this:

1.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2.Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.
3.Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.
4.Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.

The <li> element can contain any element which is valid within the <body> tag. 
This means that we can have lists of videos, images, songs, hyperlinks, or any combination thereof. In fact, we can even have lists of lists!

The <img> Allows you to add an image to a web page.
<img> is a self-closing tag. end of the <img> tag has a forward slash /.

The <img> tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute must be set to the image's source, or the location of the image. 
In this case, the value of src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored
<src> = source

<img src="imgage-location.jpg" />

The Alt attribute which means "Alternative Text" brings meaning to the images on our sites
The alt attribute can be added to the img tag just like the src attribute
The value of the alt should be the describtion of the image.

<img src="#" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />

Alt serves the purpose of giving a description of the image incase the image fails to load on a web page.
Screen reading software can read the images description
Helps with Search Engine Optimization
Having alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.

Html also supports displaying Videos
<video> tag requires a src attribute with a link to the video source
<video> requires an opening and closing tag </video>
After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. 
The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip

Boolean attributes have true/false conditions. Including a boolean attribute within an element signifies the condition is true (or on) 
while omitting it signifies the condition is false (or off

We do have an alternative to alt (alternate text) that works across all browsers, the title attribute is valid on the VIDEO element

Video Elements
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video
https://www.w3.org/

We declare a title, then we have start & end point for it, <title> </title>
We write a paragraph just for others to see, then we use <p> and close it with </p>
We declare a specific piece of this text for e.g. to be in French. We then use<span> & close it as </span>
We declare some words to be in bold or italics, again we have start & end of the text we want to format, so <strong> & </strong> <em> & </em>
We group elements, again we need to declare which items are to be grouped together. So again, we have an open close case <div> </div>. Same when we create lists, ordered or unordered ones.
Whereas,

We insert a line break in a specific point, so we say <br> once. A line break is going to be formatted, without any other need.
We insert an image in a specific point, so we say <img> once. Again, thereâ€™s no need to close anything, as we say <br> and <img> are self-closing tags
