In Javascript the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions
that we can use in our code.

Keywords are built into Javascript Lang. Computer will recognize and respond according

Console.log() - Whats put in paranthesis will get printed/logged to the console
Useful to print values to console so we can see the work that we're doing

Writing comments in your code that the computer will ignore as our program runs.

A single line comment will comment out a single line with // Symbol before it
can also use after a line of code

A multi-Line comment will comment out multiple lines using /* at the beginning and
*/ at the end of the comment
Can also use to comment something out in the middle of code.

Different Data types or Classifactions for data used in programming
There are seven Fundamental data types

1. Numbers, Any number including numbers with decimals.
2. String. Any grouping of characters on your keyboard.(Letters,numbers,spaces,symbols)
surrounded by Single quotes ' ...' or double quotes "..." String = Text

3.Boolean. Has two possible values either True or False (Without Quotes)
Used alot for yes or no questions

4.Null - Represents intentional Absensce of a value and is represented by keyword Null

5. Undefined. Represents absence of a value though it has a difference use than null
represented by Undefined

6.Symbol. A newfeature to the language. Unique Identifiers. useful in more complex coding.

7. Object: Collections of related data

First 6 types are considered Primitive Data Types.

An Operator is a character that performs a task in code.
Arithmetic Operators that allow you to perform Math Calculations on Numbers
Add : +
Subtract : -
Multiply: *
Divide: /
Remainder: %
If you want to print an equation as a string wrap them in quotes

The remainder operator sometimes called Modulo, returns the numbers that remains
when dividing

String Concatenation is when adding one string to another right to left

Console.log("Hello" + "There");

Every String instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters
in that string. You can retrieve propery info by attaching the text with a period and 
property name.
console.log('hello'.length);
prints 5

Methods are actions we can perform. Number of string methods. 
Calling a Method to perform an action. Such as Text editing or True/False
Attaching an Instance(Property) with a period (the dot operator) and paranthesis
'example string'.methodName()
console.log('hello'.toUpperCase())
List of built-in String Methods https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype
Describes Keywords, Methods and Syntax

Standard Built-in Objects
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects

Built in objects that have call methods. Sometimes used to perform more complex Mathematical
Operations than arithemtic. Built in Math object.
Math.Random - Returns a random Number between 0 and 1. *100 Multiply result
Math.floor - Makes output a whole number
